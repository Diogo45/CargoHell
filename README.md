Cargo Hell is a 2D side scroller spaceship shooter game where your only weapon available is a reflector shield!

Initially developed for the Digital Games Development discipline of the undergraduate course in Computer Science at PUCRS, we are still working on adding new features for a future release.

Such features include:
- Even more levels, enemies, and boss fights;
- A tutorial session with dialogue, explaining the lore and contextualizing the player;
- Original assets (sprites, art and even more original music);
- Upgrade shop where you can spend your score points to purchase ship improvements;
- And last but not least, a level editor where players can create and share their own levels using the enemies from the game.

We currently have released the first alpha version of the game on [Itch.io](https://diogo45.itch.io/cargo-hell), which is undergoing an open playtest phase to collect feedback.
Stay tuned for more updates!
